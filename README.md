# SkyFill
Fill the top of clear skies in stitched panoramas
Currently, it is designed to work with 4 channel TIFF files from Hugin.
Having the corresponding .pto for the project is very helpful as skyfill
is able to parse the .pto file for relavent information (FOV) to help predict
the sky image needed to blend with the stitched image coming from Hugin
