# SkyFill
Fill the top of clear skies in stitched panoramas

Currently, it is designed to work with 4 channel, 8 or 16 bit TIFF files from Hugin.
Because of artifacts created in jpeg compression, there is no attempt to provide I/O for jpeg files

Having the corresponding .pto for the project is *extremely* helpful as skyfill
is able to parse the .pto file for relavent information (FOV) to help predict
the sky image needed to blend with the stitched image coming from Hugin

*************************************************************************
As of Feb 12, 2022 This is alpha level code.  Major development has ended, and documentation has begun
Only bugs found will be addressed.  Bugs do not include very hard cases of images where the sky is
too complex for SkyFill to get a good estimate of where the sky is, and how to fill various areas of
the sky

* Thomas Modes for providing CMake functionality, and finding compilation issues on Windows.

**Getting Started**
* Create a 8 or 16 bit stitched panorama with hugin, it must be 4 channel.  Hugin sets alpha to 0 for areas with
  no image data.  You can aquire your image via another method but this is specifically designed for Hugin.  If you
  don't have Hugin and know the Horizontal FOV, specify it on the commandline with (-FOV \<degrees\>)

* Run it with skyfill\_tif \<inputimage\> \<outputimage\>

* Skyfill detects the start of sky, and end of sky for each column (X value) in the image.  *If it does not get the
  end of sky correct (usually by marking the end of sky below the actual end of sky), the subsequent estimate of HSV will be 
  corrupted by using non-sky pixels in the estimate of actual sky HSV.*   Vegetation, clouds are examples of potential problems.
  Skyfill analyzes the sky in columns (i.e. the "y") dimension.  It starts at the first opaque pixels in an image column and
  moves downward until 2 or more adjacent pixels in the column do not match the expected values for the sky in that localize
  area.

  - Run skyfill with the -d3 flag to see where it identified the start and end of sky is at.  It will put a green line two pixels
    *below* where it has identified the end of sky, so you can visually see if the actual pixel color at the detected
    end of sky looks correct.
  - If the end of sky looks incorrect, the only option to fix it is by changing the tolerances for end of sky detection
     "-tol \<t\>" -- tolerance for determining edge of skyline at horizon, default is 3.5  Increasing the tolerance will cause
     the algorithm to move farther down the sky in a column.  Decreasing the tolerance will have the opposit effect.

**Masks**
* Masks are potentially an important option for handling images that are not simple situations with unobstructed clear sky at
  the top of the image
* Column Mask
  "-m \<l\> \<r\>"  -- this flag prevents any analysis, or changes to image columns from *l* to *r*
* Sample Mask
  "-sm \<l\> \<r\>"  -- this flag prevents using image columns from *l* to *r* as estimates of clear sky for purposes of modelling the 
  sky HSV values
* Repair Mask
  "-rm \<l\> \<r\>"  -- this flag prevents image columns from *l* to *r* from having changes make to pixels in the sky, though
  the area may still be used for sampling actual sky values
* Non Sky Repair Mask
  "-nsrm \<l\> \<r\>"  -- this flag prevents image columns from *l* to *r* from having changes make to pixels in the sky
  which are classsified as likely to be not a sky pixel (i.e. a cloud, or a piece of vegetation)
* Test Mask
  "-tm \<left\> \<right\> \<top\> \<bottom\>"  -- this flag identifies a rectangle that is skipped over for end of sky detection,
  and no sky samples are taken in the rectangle.  In the examples, this has been used to exclude regions with direct sun and
  lens flare that are in the actual sky area, but would be bad to use for detecting end of sky and for modelling the sky color

**Normal sky replacement**
    After a sky HSV model has been created by SkyFill, column by column, it blends the modelled sky (now starting at y=0), and
    blending to a y value that is 50% of the way from the first opaque pixel (top of sky), to the identified end of sky.  The
    "-df \<D\>" flag determines how far down to stop the blending.  The default is 50% 
    "-df 0", would leave the original sky pixels completely
    unchanged and only fill in the pixels above -- leaving a noticeable seam due to errors from the sky model.  "-df 1." will
    fill sky pixels all the way down to the detected end of sky.  The blending uses 100% of the modelled sky at the original top
    of the sky in the image, and linearly changes to using 100% of the original pixel value at the lowest (largest y) pixel changed.

    Note that if the end of sky is highly variable, there may be some visible artifacts in the resulting sky from this method
    and it would be worth trying Full Sky Replacement Mode

**Full Sky Replacement Mode**

* When you run it in full sky replacement mode (-fsr).  The placement of the horizon determines the lowest part of the image
  where any pixel replacement will occur. To see how far down in the image replacement is going to occur, run it with an undocumented
  flag (-SRE).  The output will be grayscale down to the horizon (which may be curved).  White pixels will be fully replaced,
  black pixels will not be replaced.  You can move the horizon line with the -hy \<p\> flag, where \<p\>=1.0 is the top of the image,
  \<p\>=0.5 is halfway between the top and bottom...

* In this mode, you can supply parameters for putting a modelled sun in the sky.  The actual sun diameter is much smaller in an
  image than you might first guess, because so much of the area around the sun has been blown out and exceeded the sensor maximum
  value.   The parameters for defining the sun are:
  * -sx \<Xangle\> -- in degrees -- Xangle of 0 is the middle of the image, Xangle=-FOV/2 is left side of image, Xangle=FOV/2 is right side of image
  * -sy \<Py\> -- as a proportion, 1 is top of image, 0 is bottom of image
  * --- note, you can put the sun outside of the image, and get just some glow from the modelled sun to appear in the image
  * -C \<Cvalue\> -- overall brighness of the sun.  Default is 2
  * -D \<Dvalue\> -- overall diameter of the sun.  Default is .01  You *must* set this to a large value, try the range 1 to 10.  The "size" of the
                   generated sun will be somewhat linear with respect to the Dvalue chosen
  * -F \<Fvalue\> -- Blending amount of the modelled sun into the normal modelled sky, default is 0.5
  * -G \<Gvalue\> -- This controls how much of the sun+modelled sky to use in replacing pixel values.  Think of this as a "blending factor" that overrides
                   the normal top of sky to end of sky blending factor.  Gvalue is given as a proportional distance (where the proportions are 0 to 1 for
		   both image width and image height)  Default is 0, so you *must* set this to a nonzero value to have an effect.  Try small values, .1 is
		   a good first try
