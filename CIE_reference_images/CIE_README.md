# CIE reference images
These are representations of the CIE Sky model for 17 predetermined
sets of coefficients.  1 thru 16 are from the CIE standards themselves
17 is one i made that give a stronger, more blended horizon glow

The CIE model, only predicts sky radiation intensity (Like Watts per square
meter of sky).  Adjustments to saturation are for visual purposes.  SkyFill
attempts a better model of saturation as a function of sky radation intensity

These images represent a 360 horizonal view, and from 0 degrees to 90 degrees
on the vertical.
